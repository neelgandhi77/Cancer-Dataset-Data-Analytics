## Lung Cancer-Dataset-Data-Analytics
This dataset contains information on patients with lung cancer, including their age, gender, air pollution exposure, alcohol use, dust allergy, occupational hazards, genetic risk, chronic lung disease, balanced diet, obesity, smoking status, passive smoker status, chest pain, coughing of blood, fatigue levels , weight loss , shortness of breath , wheezing , swallowing difficulty , clubbing of finger nails , frequent colds , dry coughs , and snoring. By analyzing this data we can gain insight into what causes lung cancer and how best to treat it.
# The objective of this project is to develop a lung cancer prediction model using a multivariate lung cancer dataset. The primary goals include performing data cleaning to ensure data integrity, handling missing and applying feature selection and elimination techniques to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset. The project aims to evaluate the performance of multiple classification models, including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes and Decision Tree, in predicting lung cancer. The accuracy of each model will be assessed, and the ROC curves will be plotted to analyse the trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate. The ultimate objective is to identify the most accurate classification model for lung cancer prediction and provide insights into the relationship between the dataset attributes and the occurrence of lung cancer.
